Currently a DevOps Engineer. Enjoying working with Kubernetes at scale and improving processes and developer experience.

Reading lots of scifi books, really like Clarkesworld magazine for the short stories.

Always looking for new and cool film/tv to watch.

Got two cats called Shadow and Lilly who I love dearly.
