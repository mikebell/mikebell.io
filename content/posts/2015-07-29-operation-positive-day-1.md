Today was the first day of Operation Positive. The challenge is to not to be negative in the aim of changing how I think.

It was a failure but that was to be expected and not a huge problem. Below are things from the day that are note worthy:

- I ran the internal retrospective there were negative things on there. Way more positive things though!
- Many meetings, my default state is all meetings are bad even if they aren't.
- Struggling to feel like I'm doing a good job.
- Staying positive is hard and tiring.

I'll try and blog everyday on how things are going. It should be interesting to see how forcing myself to be positive works out. I'm also want to write more about my daily work and how it makes me feel but it's always difficult to word things so people don't panic, so we'll see how that goes.
