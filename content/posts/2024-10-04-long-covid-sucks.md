This week I had some pretty crappy news, I had a chest x-ray on Saturday because my lungs feel like I'm breathing razor blades. The nice doctor said that it was most likely down to post/long COVID. It's kinda a good thing to know because that explains why I've been feeling so grim since I last had COVID. The x-ray shows I have scarring and dark spots on my lungs which is what's causing all the discomfort. I've got a blue inhaler in case which helps a bit but for the most part it just sucks.

I've been feeling even worse than usual at the moment, my brain is so foggy, I'm even more tired ha tired doens't even cover it I'm exhausted. I'm struggling to get out of bed in the morning which isn't like me at all. I've found that when things are really bad loud noises are hurting my ears, that's never happened before. To top it all off I'm having palpatations every so often.

There's absolutely fuck all I can do about it either, I just have to put my life on hold while I expend all my energy working and trying to get through the day, it's not really much of a life. My mental health is pretty crap at the moment because of it, but I have hope that I'll come through it, may not be tomorrow or next week but it has to get better.

So yeah that about sums things up, fuck COVID tbh.

> As a side note I'm only really writing this so I can play around more with neovim :)
