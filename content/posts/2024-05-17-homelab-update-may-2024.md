Here's a very quick update on my homelab.

## Changelog

* Deprecated Homer
* Implemented [gethomepage.dev](https://gethomepage.dev)
* Update all the containers
* Implemented [FressRSS](https://freshrss.org/index.html)
* Semi-deprecated Commafeed

## gethomepage.dev

Not sure where I picked this up from but it's been really cool so far. I really like the service discovery using docker labels and widgets that pull in additional information.

##Â FreshRSS

I looked at FreshRSS before I went with commafeed but dismissed it for some reason. I've enjoyed using commafeed for a while but found it's mobile and tablet ui not amazing. With FreshRSS I can use a third party client with it although I've not found I've needed to yet. The baked in Nord colour scheme is really nice as well.

## Future

I'm looking into setting up Nextcloud and Immich. I want Nextcloud as a replacement for Google Drive and Immich to replace Google Photos. All of this is part of a longer term de-googling. Another step forward will be to remove SSO from as many places as possible.
