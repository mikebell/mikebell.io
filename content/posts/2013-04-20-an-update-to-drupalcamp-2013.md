There's no easy way to put this but as of this post I'm withdrawing from organising DrupalCamp NW 2013.

A lot of things have changed over the past 4 months some good some not so. I intend to spend as much time with my friends and family and avoid the stress of organising the event.

Where does this leave the event? Pretty much in the same place as it was a few months ago, I'd love for more people to step up and take charge of the event. Nothing would make me happier than attending DCNW 2013 as an attendee for a change! Hell I might actually see some sessions.

If you would like to get involved then please come along to the next NWDUG (7pm 1st May at Madlab) or get in touch with either me or Phil Norton.
