The past three weeks have been crazy.

Week 1 - Barcelona

Week 2 - Packing house

Week 3 - PHPNW

Now - Moved in

So lets just recap, I keynoted at Barcelona, packed up my flat, spoke at PHPNW and then moved house the day after.

I'm shattered, mentally and physically now. I've got a few blog posts in draft about both DrupalCon and PHPNW which I'll put out when I get chance. For the time being I have to tether of my phone and I'm loving snuggling on the couch with Hannah so I'm scaling back my online access for a bit.
