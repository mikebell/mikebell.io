This morning I decided to document all the issues I had with Spotify over the passed 4 hours. Here is a list:

* Persistent notifications - It's gone from 3 to 1 without me doing anything!
* Flashing UI - Randomly flashes distracting me from work.
* Doesn't remember position when viewing all albums.
* Playing a track in all albums view doesn't appear on the specific album view - it appears like albums on artists pages aren't linked.
* Shows wrong track playing in the bottom left corner.
* Giving the window focus took me to the top of the artists page for no reason.

Worst thing is I pay for this as well. When did we come to accept bad software?
