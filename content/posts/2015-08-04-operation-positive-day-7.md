Status: Fail

Just couldn't seem to get into today at all. Didn't help that I had no appetite all day and only had porridge for lunch. Coffee did nothing to help me at all.

Pretty much everything I worked on today was one of those problems where the only solution was to just start all over again.

I find it really tough to be positive sometimes.
