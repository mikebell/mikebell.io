Conference season is looming pretty fast, I'm giving talks at two of my most respected conferences.

Being able to talk is a great thing, I love the fact that I can do it what I don't like is the afterwards. It's an odd time, the adrenalin is fading and tiredness overwhelms me. I usually spend the rest of the day (or what's left of it) wandering around taking questions and attending sessions. In the evening there are usually parties so I attend them in the hope of catching up with old and new friends.

But... I can't help but feel alone in a room of hundreds. I noticed this at last years PHPNW, I was stood in the middle of the main party and I just felt alone.

This year is going to be different, I want to make new friends, I want to meet people who are my heroes in both the PHP and Drupal community. I don't want to be known as digita| on IRC, I'm Mike.

And I think that's it, I'm Mike if you see me at PHPNW or DrupalCon Barcelona come say hi, I'll try not to be too awkward.
