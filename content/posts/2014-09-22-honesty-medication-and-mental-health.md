Again it’s been too long since my last post, I seem to come up with ideas and start planning it out in my head only to end up with a rambling nonsensical rant on where I am and what I’ve gone through. This time I’m going to structure it and make sure I get my point across.

## Honesty

I’m now a lot more honest, with myself and those around me. It’s vital to where I am that I am honest, it’ll help detect and issues in the future and make sure that I keep those around me in the loop about how I’m feeling. This has become so vital to how I recover as I can no longer hide behind lies and the misconception that everything is fine.

## Medication

I’m currently on two types of medication, one for anxiety and one for depression. These have both helped a hell of a lot and I don’t think I’d be where I am without them. That being said I need to slowly come off them, this is scaring me  more than I thought it would, I’m not sure what part of my mind is me recovering or the medication. I guess I will just have to see what happens once I start to come off them.

## Mental Health

A friend pointed me towards [@funkatron](https://twitter.com/funkatron) and his set of talks on Open Source and Mental Health, these have helped me get a better grasp on things, I highly suggest you check them out. I’m currently in the process of putting together a lightning talk for PHPNW on some of the subjects [@funkatron](https://twitter.com/funkatron) touches on and what I’ve been through these past few months. It’s important for me that I can help anyone in anyway, even if it’s just 20 minutes and only one person turns up.
