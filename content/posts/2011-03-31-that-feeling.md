You know that feeling... the one where your 2000 meters up staring out over snow covered mountains shaking snow off your skis, looking down the hill, picking the line, clearing your mind, ready for that one last push, sinking down as your skis carve through the snow, leaning into corners as you sweep round effortless turns. Then you reach the bottom, look back up, breath in deeply and sink into an adrenaline induced warm cloudy feeling.

I get this feeling everytime I ski, whether on my own or with my family, it's why I love doing it.
