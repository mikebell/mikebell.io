I'm half writing this for the people mentioned at the end and my own records since when I say the past 5 days has been crazy I really mean it. You can read a bit of back story [here](https://mikebell.io/posts/long-covid-sucks/).

## 17th October

Varicocile Embolisation - a simple surgery to get rid of the varicose vein on my left testicle (yes it can be as painful as it sounds). 4-5 hours waiting for a 30 min op no worries. Feeling a bit grim but that's kinda to be expected.

## 18th October

Off work, feeling a bit rough, put it down to the operation the previous day.

## 19th October

Went for a walk around the park and a quick visit to the pub, had a soft drink and start feeling really bad, make my excuses and head home where I spend the rest of the day on the sofa. When trying to stand up I felt like I was going to pass out.

## 20th October

Needed to go shopping and could barely make it to the end of the road, managed it around Morrisons and headed home. I have a cheap sp02 monitor so tried that and my pulse was over 140 and sp02 89% (anything below 95% is bad). Decided to lay on the sofa and try and recover but about an hour later I'm still the same and feeling really faint. Took myself off to A & E and spent the next 4 hours (super impressed at how quick everything went) being triaged and taken care of. By this point I was struggling to breath and could barely talk. Another chest x-ray later and the doctor says the dark spots on my lungs are most likely blood clots. Perscribed Apixaban (a blood) and sent home, told I would receive a request for an emergency CT scan in the next 2-3 days. By this point I'm really sick.

## 21st October

I have to go back to the hospital to pick up the rest of the Apixaban, on the way back home I get a call asking me to come back at 2pm for a CT scan. I wasn't expecting it to be that quick but glad. Head back to the hospital and have my CT scan, it was a quick in and out once we found the right department. Head back home and try to start resting then I get another phone call to say I have to go back for overnight observation the dark spots on my lungs are blood clots and it's quite serious, it really sucks but figure it's for the best. When I get there I had multiple consultants tell me how serious things are and I'm given a bed and some anti clotting drugs. I'll spare you the shit nights sleep but my gods it was horrible.

## 22nd October

All my tests came back as slightly improved, it looks like the blood thinners are working. I still feel really crap but I can walk without losing my breath and the chances of a brain/heart clot are hopefully a lot lower now. I then got discharged pretty quickly which was nice and now I'm here writing this. I'm exhausted now and having to take things incredibly easy. My resting heart rate is between 87-100 because my right lung is causing problems with my heart. It's going to take about 2 weeks for this to normalise. So when people say COVID isn't serious point them in my direction. I also look like a pin cushion now.

## Next steps

I need a scan on my heart to make sure there's no permanent damage. I've got a referral to a specialist but that will be another 3-6 months down the line.

## Thanks

Huge thanks to Han, Mum (stop worrying), Dad (yes I know you've had this, let me have my spotlight), James, Dave, Paula, Jim, Mark, Beth, Chris, Jess, Jane, Mark, Gem and Steve. Your messages/calls/support has got me through the past 3 days more than I can ever properly explain. If I've forgotten anyone else then I'm sorry I'm running on about 4 hours sleep.
