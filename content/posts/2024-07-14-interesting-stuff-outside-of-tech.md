I spend all my online life in tech (I started setting up devenv.sh while I had covid ffs) so decided to branch out and find other things to read that are interesting but NOT tech related (maybe).

[Matt Lakeman - Notes on Tajikistan](https://mattlakeman.org/2024/06/20/notes-on-tajikistan/)

I found this from Hacker News and decided to give it a click not only is it really interesting but it's very well written. Matts humour comes across really well and I like it. There's a heavy emphasis on history which isn't quite my thing but the actual details of his travels is something else. I wish I'd have the guts to travel to some of the places he has.

[My Diplomatic Life](https://mydiplomaticlife.com/how-to-survive-3-years-in-north-korea-as-a-foreigner/)

What's life like as a diplomat in North Korea? Go give it a read it's fascinating. I've always had a interest in the Hermit Kingdom ever since Vice (rip) videos on it many years ago. I'm really surprised at the freedom he had while in NK.

[Youtube - Studio](https://www.youtube.com/@_wearestudio)

A Youtube channel that has lots of live sets from some of my favourite DJS. Great to have on in the background or just chilling out and listening to some great DnB/Nuerofunk. There's a relatively rare set from Billain on there which I'd recommend checking out. Oh also Current Value, a Russian DJ living in Berlin who cranks out some amazing music.

That's about it for now, this is just a little brain dump while I try and get back into blogging a bit more.
