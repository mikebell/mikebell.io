A long time ago I got ill, I was doing my mock GCSEs and got flu. A few weeks later I was at the doctors because I was exhausted. My parents started to notice that I wasn't myself and was starting to struggle with things. The doctor eventually diagnosed me with ME/CFS. An illness which at best makes me tired at worst makes my arms ache, my brain fog up and my general quality of life pretty bad.

I've had this thing for over 20 years now and never really spoke about it, I don't tell my colleagues or bosses, even some of my friends don't know not because I don't trust them but because I just want to be a normal human.

So why speak about it now? Ever since Covid things have been worse, before I was 70% human now I'm 50% human. I hide it well but it's got to the point where I can't hide any more. I've started specialised ME/CFS therapy to help me understand and deal with living life like it is now. One thing I've learnt is that I don't put myself first, I'm afraid how people will see me or that I'm not doing my job properly. I have so much pent up guilt about having this condition.
