The title pretty much sums it up, BPEs suck.

## How did we get here

For most of the year I'd been feeling a bit off it, dizzy spells and being exhausted, I put this down to ME/CFS being a pain as per usual. In June we went to Cyprus for two weeks holiday it was hot but we had such a great time. When I got back I caught COVID (4th times the charm), whenever I get it I'm always very ill with it. 2 weeks after COVID I got a chest infection which was quite bad, I never really recovered afterwards. We're pretty sure this is where it all went wrong and the bloods clots in my lungs started to form. From there my health has deteriorated to the point where I've been backwards and forwards to the doctors. Each time I went I was told the chest infection hadn't gone and given either an inhaler or more medication. It was also around this time that I noticed my chest was aching, I have acid reflux and well and while it's been managed for years and years I'd been getting aches and what felt like acid reflux again. 

When I look back all the signs that something was seriously wrong was there but because I've seen so many different doctors and nurse practitioners that there was never any chance of it actually being picked up as what it really was. I'm not blaming anyone (apart from maybe a certain political party). I'll be clear that I love the NHS and are very greatful for how I've been treated over the past week or so, without them I frankly wouldn't be here now.

## Anger

I'm not proud of it but I can't help and look at other people who're twice my weight and smoke 800 cigarettes a day and wonder why me. It makes me really angry and I know it shouldn't but it's hard not to. I can count the amount of cigarettes I've smoked in my life on 2 hands, yes I'm overweight but I'm exercising regularly and love walking.

I've been dealing with ME/CFS ever since I was 16 years old, I don't need any more crap!
