My colleague and friend Gem Hill has published her first podcast on Scrum and Agile.

It's an interesting insight into the Scrum/Agile process outside of a developers perspective.

She raises some good points on the value of acceptance criteria and being flexible in it's implementation.

You can get the first episode here - https://letstalkabouttests.wordpress.com/ - Don't forget to like/subscribe/comment/socialmediathehelloutofit.
