I've been collecting watches for 10 years now there's something about them that really appeals to me. I rarely ever show them off they're quite a personal part of me and each watch has it's own story. For reasons that most watch collectors will understand (even if they don't practice) I have strict rules on purchasing watches:

1. I can only own 6 at a time.
2. No watch over Â£2000 (Moonwatch will break this eventually)
3. The watch must either be automatic/solar/kinetic

The only rule I've struggled with is 1, letting go of a watch is always hard and it's like letting a piece of me go, apart from the Samsung Galaxy watch 5, that thing sucked and I'm not a fan of smart watches.

In no particular order:

## Stowa Ikarus

This has just recently passed it's 10 year birthday. I bought it around the time I got engaged so it's become my engagement watch, it was going to be my wedding watch (my dad did the same) but my partner convinced me to get a ring instead. This is a pretty interesting watch, when Stowa first released them they didn't come with an onion crown I had to ask for this especially. They'd later start including the onion crown on all future versions. It also has their "upgraded" movement which looks stunning. It's quite a classy watch and goes with formal wear if I ever have the occasion to wear a suit (never).

## Stowa Flieger Classic 40

This is the watch I really wanted when I got the Ikarus but I couldn't afford it. I finally pulled the trigger last year to celebrate finishing 2 shitty jobs and moving onto my latest role. Me and my partner have an inside joke that it's the watch that $work bought. I absolutely adore this watch you can wear it with anything and easily get lost in the dial. Even though it was bought around the time when things weren't great it'll always be something I'm proud and happy to wear.

> We're a Stowa family, a few years after I bought the Ikarus my brother bought a Marine and not long after that my dad bought a limited edition Marine Blue Automatik as a birthday present for himself.

## Casio G-Shock GW-M5610U-1ER

This is my first G-Shock and first solar watch. It's an amazing looking piece, it's not huge and in your face like other G-Shocks, I've knocked it around a fair bit when doing work around the house or in a data centre. It's traveled with me on cruises and always kept the correct time. I love it for just how indestructible it is. The only reason I knew this existed was because at the time an ex-colleague showed me the [Bamford](https://g-shock.co.uk/gw-m5610bwd20-1er) version (I still want it but refuse to pay what it's going for now) but it was out of stock everywhere. If you're looking for a cheap and practical watch then this is for you.

## Casio G-Shock GW-M5610U-1BER

This is the "inverted" version of the 1ER. It's difficult to read without the backlight and I absolutely love it. Both the 1ER and 1BER often go on sale for 20/30% off on Amazon so if you keep an eye out then you can get a bargain.
