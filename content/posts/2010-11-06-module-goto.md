Module Goto is a small module that extends the great Root Candy theme for Drupal, it provides simple menu that appears on the right hand side of the module page which allows you to click and navigate between the different field sets. This is immensely helpful when you have hundreds of modules available in a multisite configuration.

The process is pretty simple, it loops through all the fieldsets on the module list page and creates links to them, it uses the jQuery plugin scrollTo to do the physical movement.

I've uploaded the project to github and can be found at: [https://github.com/mikebell/modulegoto](https://github.com/mikebell/modulegoto)

Feel free to fork and play around with it, all I ask is that you commit back any helpful changes. I'm looking at adding in other theme support soon and moving some of the javascript work into php.

Enjoy
