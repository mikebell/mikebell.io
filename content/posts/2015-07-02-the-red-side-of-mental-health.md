There's a side of mental health that I haven't openly talked about. That side is money. Not an easy thing to talk about.

When I went off work I was on full paid leave for the maximum amount of days, I then went on to statutory. Statutory didn't even cover my rent so I blew through *all* my savings while I was off work.

Like mental health in general the financial recovery has been difficult. I could have made it a lot easier on myself but I thought it was important to at least keep up with at least 60-70% of my normal life. 

Last month was the first month I've been out of my overdraft, it marks another step in my recovery, it makes things like houses, holidays and children more of a reality.
