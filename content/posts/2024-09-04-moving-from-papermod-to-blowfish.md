Title pretty much sums it up, when you see this post the theme will have changed.

<!-- more -->

PaperMod has served me well over the years but I was getting that itch to try something different and it didn't support having drop down menus. Having the ability to have drop down menus is quite important now, I want to keep my menu clean but still have room for pages like [slashpages](https://slashpages.net/) (I'll be adding more soon) and pages that don't fit into my blog but are still important like my [watch collection](/watches).

[Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) isn't perfect though, for some reason content has this awkward width on my screen that I need to fix. I'm sure there's a proper reason for it but to me it doesn't quite look right. I'm impressed at just how configurable Blowfish is though, it's taken me a few days to get the configuration right but I'm happy to push it live now.

## Todo

1. Fix awkward content width
2. Photos for watch page
3. Figure out how to get the Nord theme working
