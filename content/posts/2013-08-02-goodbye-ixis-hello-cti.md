After 3 and a half years at Ixis I'm sad to say goodbye. I think it's time to move on and explore new opportunities. My time at Ixis has been great, the people are amazing and it's been a pleasure to help shape their infrastructure and deliver sites for them.

I'll be joining CTI mid August as Drupal Technical Architect a role which I cannot wait to start, I'm also looking forward to working with Paul Johnson and Mark West. It will allow me to do more development (no more support YES!!!) and work on Drupal 7 and 8 with a bigger team to deliver technically challenging projects.

I wish everyone at Ixis good luck in the future and to give me a shout if they ever fancy a beer in Manchester.
