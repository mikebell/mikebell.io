# Mike Bell
### DevOps Engineer - Remote & Manchester UK

## About me

I'm a DevOps Engineer who's primary focus is to help others do their jobs easier and better. I love building new things and getting my hands dirty on projects. I maintain my own ProxMox server in my garage where I run a lot of home automation software and various lab exercises. Outside of my home office I love to build Lego, design and build custom keyboards, lounge by the pool in a hot country, cook and play with my 2 awesome cats.

This is a Drupal 7 build which consists of a form which has many different workflow states based on user type and selections throughout the application. Users are then added to a workflow system in which they are moderated based on their application. Majority of the project was completed using third party modules, custom development was required in smaller areas to enhance on existing Drupal modules.
