# Mike Bell
### DevOps Engineer - Remote & Manchester UK

## About me

I'm a DevOps Engineer that focuses on helping others do their jobs easier and better. I love building new things and getting my hands dirty on projects. I maintain my own ProxMox server in my garage where I run a lot of home automation software and various lab exercises. Outside of my home office I love to build Lego, design and build custom keyboards, lounge by the pool in a hot country, cook and play with my 2 awesome cats.

## Employment History

**DevOps Engineer (previously Senior Developer) - Convivio - June 2016 to Present**

Cabinet Office National Leadership Centre - I helped to build and maintain an AWS EKS cluster for their now defunct leadership network Connect. The major objective of the project was to compare existing architectures available through the Government such as GOV.UK PaaS and GDS Kubernetes, once it was determined that neither we're viable we designed and built our own. Following building our own we made sure to open source [our](https://github.com/cabinetoffice/national-leadership-centre-terragrunt) [work](https://github.com/cabinetoffice/national-leadership-centre-terraform) to create a repeatable UK government friendly Kubernetes cluster.
