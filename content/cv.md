# Mike Bell
### DevOps Engineer - Remote & Manchester UK

## About me

I'm a DevOps Engineer who's primary focus is to help others do their jobs easier and better. I love building new things and getting my hands dirty on projects. I maintain my own ProxMox server in my garage where I run a lot of home automation software and various lab exercises. Outside of my home office I love to build Lego, design and build custom keyboards, lounge by the pool in a hot country, cook and play with my 2 awesome cats.
