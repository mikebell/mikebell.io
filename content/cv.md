# Mike Bell
## Platform and Cloud Engineer - Remote & Manchester UK

Platform and Cloud Engineer focused on AWS and GCP, management, building and maintaining of infrastructure and projects.

I’ve been remote working for over 8 years, taking responsibility of my own time management and ability to work with teams based anywhere in the world. At Spareroom I build and manage enterprise level infrastructure, support critical applications and maintain testing applications.

Outside of work I maintain my own on-prem and cloud infrastructure where I run multiple VMs and containers focusing on home automation software. When not working I love to build Lego, design and build custom keyboards, cook and play with my cats.

#### DevOps Engineer (previously Senior Developer) - Convivio - June 2016 to February 2021

**Cabinet Office National Leadership Centre** - I helped to build and maintain an AWS EKS cluster for their now defunct Leadership Network Connect. The first objective of the project was to compare existing architectures available through the Government such as GOV.UK PaaS and GSP (GDS Supported Platform), while both have their benefits we were unable to use them for our needs so proceeded to build our own. Following building our own we made sure to open source [our](https://github.com/cabinetoffice/national-leadership-centre-terragrunt) [work](https://github.com/cabinetoffice/national-leadership-centre-terraform) to create a repeatable UK government friendly Kubernetes cluster.
