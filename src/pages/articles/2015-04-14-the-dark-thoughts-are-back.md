There I said it. I'm angry I want to punch the wall till my fists bleed.

I'm stressed and it's starting to show, the cracks are appearing, I can feel my brain tearing itself apart.

I know what I need to do and I've set things in motion for that. I hate feeling like this and don't want it to continue.
