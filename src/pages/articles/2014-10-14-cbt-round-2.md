I had my second round of CBT today and it went much better than the first round. This time I took a bottle of water with me it gave me something to focus on and stop my hands from getting all weird, it's also amazing how thirsty you get during these things.

The session was focused on a few situations over the past few weeks where I've had issues with anxiety and panic attacks. We identified things about the situations and how I should be dealing with them.

I feel much more positive after today's session and I'm glad that I'm sticking with it, I can see that this will help me and provide me with the tools to help control my thoughts better.
