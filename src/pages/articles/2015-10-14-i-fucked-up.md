I fucked up and I fucked up badly.

A few months ago I went cold turkey on propranolol (against all feedback) and after a few weeks the side effects went away and I was fine.

A week ago I decided to stop taking Citalopram cold turkey. This was not a good idea.

Currently I'm suffering from withdrawal symptoms, they're not very nice and they make working and life very difficult.

My symptoms include:

* Hazy head
* Extreme emotions
* Quick to anger
* Tension headaches

I've learnt my lesson and I'm going back up to 20mg and will sort out tapering off properly.

UPDATE: Today I'm feeling better after going back on them, still a bit hazy and my head aches but I'm a lot better. Don't fuck around with SSRIs
