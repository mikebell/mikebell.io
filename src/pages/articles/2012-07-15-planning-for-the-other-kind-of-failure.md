title: Planning for the other kind of failure

---
After reading way too much Hacker News and talking with a close friend recently, I stumbled across an interesting problem with new startups and their plan for the future.

## Plan for failure
For those not familiar with this concept it's a fairly simple one, you take your hipster nodejs/rails app and make it scale across multiple servers and data centres so when your cloud hosting fails your app doesn't fall over in a pile of flames.

## The other failure
This failure is even more depressing than server failure. What happens when your funding runs out and your app hasn't taken off? What are you going to do?

## What is the other failure?
Like most applications I'm going to assume your taking a users data and doing something with it. What happens if your company fails, how do I get my data out?

## Data is the most valuable currency
