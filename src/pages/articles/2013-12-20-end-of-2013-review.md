I'm sat hear listening to the new Burial Ep - Rival Dealer and thinking about the year that's past.

This year has been quite a ride for me. 

I met Hannah who has become a huge part of my life. 

I turned down a job I would later regret and rectify. 

Watched as loved ones passed away. Held Hannah close.

Decided to quit my job and move on to harder challenges.

This means I'm in a much better place.

2014 will prove to be pretty damned awesome.
