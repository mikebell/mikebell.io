I've been suffering from depression and severe anxiety for the past 6 months now. It's costing me my girlfriend, job and most importantly my life.

I woke up yesterday with my heart pounding out of my chest, I got ready for work and then threw up, I felt dizzy and very scared. All because of everything that's going on in my life. All because I've had the worst week of my entire life.

I feel like I've lost everything, I'm emotionally detached from the people I love, I'm unable to concentrate on work. I'm not even sure if people have noticed that I'm stuttering more and can barely string a sentence together when under stress. I'm not the person I was a year ago.

I don't know what to do and that makes things worse. I'm hoping that this is a step in the right direction.
