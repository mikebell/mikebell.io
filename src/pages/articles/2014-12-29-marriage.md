After an intense 6 month **anti** marriage campaign I finally proposed to Hannah (28th Dec 2014). Lucky for me she said yes.

I have fairly strong views on marriage, what it should be and what it shouldn't. I don't (or should that be didn't?) want to jump into it without being 100% sure. We've talked about marriage in the past and we both understand where we're coming from, that's what makes our relationship work so well. I finally asked her because it's my commitment to her.

Here's how it went down:

Me: *whisper* - I have a question for you.
Me: *whisper* - It might sound stupid.
Me: *whisper* - Will you marry me?
Hannah: Are you kidding me?
Me: *produces ring*
Hannah: YES!
