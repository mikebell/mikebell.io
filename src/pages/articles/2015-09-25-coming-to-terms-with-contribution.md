For a long time I wanted to contributed code to Drupal, I have a few times but no where near as much as I thought I was going to do.

I've been thinking about what this really means to me and where my contributions come from. I've only just come to terms with the fact that my contributions don't lie within code but belong in contributing to the community.

Over the next few months I'll be doing a few things:

* Working with Adam Hill to make communication in the Drupal UK community a bit easier.
* Helping Phil and Eli to grow NWDUG and take pressure off Phil.
* Speaking at PHPNW
* Other stuff

I seem to be quite comfortable doing this so I'll carry on!
