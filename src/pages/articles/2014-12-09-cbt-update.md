I gave up on CBT. The sessions were too infrequent and sporadic. I really didn’t like the over the phone sessions either they were too impersonal and didn’t really contribute anything.

The one thing I did get out of the sessions was helpful pointers with where i need to focus and what tools I need to give myself to be able to cope with things in the long run.

* I’ve started practising mediation, it gives me a sense of being and helps me re-connect my body and mind.
* I analyse my feelings more, this helps determine the cause of my anxiety and allows me to bring myself out of the spiral that are anxiety attacks.

So where do I go from here, I’m looking into more traditional therapy now, I intend to continue meditation and medication for a while longer.

I find I’m smiling more and more each day, I’m happy.
