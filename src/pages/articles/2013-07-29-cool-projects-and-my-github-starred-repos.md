title: Cool projects and my github starred repos

---
I've started to star a lot of repos on github for things that I like the look of and want to play with in the future here is a break down of some of the really cool ones.

1. https://github.com/arnoo/git-deliver - Looks like a nice tool for deploying using git, not sure about using it with Drupal though.
2. https://github.com/pearkes/tugboat - Handy tool for managing my digital ocean instances from command line
3. https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier - Create OSX notifications from the command line. I use this in my test runs so I don't have to babysit it.
4. https://github.com/dotcloud/docker - Mini linux containers, looking forward to playing around with these as throwaway Drupal sites.
