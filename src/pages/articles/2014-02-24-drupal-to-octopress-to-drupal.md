Over the weekend I’ve been working on migrating my site away from Drupal. I managed to get everything up and running on Octopress but it just doesn’t feel right.

It’s not as flexible as Drupal and it seems the simplest of things breaks it. In theory I like the concept of Octopress but it just seems clunky compared to Drupal.

I’ll be slowly making upgrades to this site:

* Adding Disqus
* Tidying the theme up
* Adding extra theme elements
* Adding some colour!!!
