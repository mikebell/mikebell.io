Dear BBC,

Today I bought a TV license. I do not own a TV. I do not watch live TV. In fact I don't do anything to warrant owning a TV license.

 I have however grown up with your science programmes. I look forward to watching the latest show that shows the most fascinating scientific breakthroughs and topics.

So as long as you keep on making great programmes such as Horizon then I'll keep paying.

 Regards,
Mike Bell
