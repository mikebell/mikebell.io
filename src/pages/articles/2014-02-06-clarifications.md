1. Calm the fuck down.
2. No I’m not quitting my job.
3. I’m happy with Drupal and will continue to work with it.
4. Those that know me should realise I’ve not worked in depth with Drupal in a *long* time.
5. My current project is great and it’s made me realise that I need to spend more time with underlying tech than just Drupal, the best way I can describe it is this project is London and Drupal is the Thames, it runs all the way through but it’s by no means the sum of all it’s parts.

Hopefully that will put things in perspective now.
