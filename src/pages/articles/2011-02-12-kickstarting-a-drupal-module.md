<p>Here's a novel idea, why not use <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/" target="_blank">Kickstarter.com</a>&nbsp;to fund module development?</p><p>For example (because we can never have to many!) a new Image Slideshow module. The base price would be say $1000 to kick start the development process.</p><p>Kickstarter allows you to have up to 3 rewards (I think it&#39;s 3) you could use this to tie in potential users and customers. Here&#39;s an example scenario:</p><p>Reward 1 - (Quantity 4) - $25 - You get 1 feature of your choice added<br />Reward 2 - (Quantity 4) - $50 - You get the module installed and implemented on your site<br />Reward 3 - (Quantity 5) - $100 - You get my first born and implemenation plus 2 hours support.</p><p>Assuming you get enough committers thats almost all $800 is covered by *potential* customers. Not a bad idea huh?</p><p>The reason I like Kickstarter -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/923846239/rosetta-junius-split-record">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/923846239/rosetta-junius-split-record</a>&nbsp;- Commitment complete within 3 hours of it going live and way more commited since, also they are a damn good band (shame about the UK tour though).</p>
