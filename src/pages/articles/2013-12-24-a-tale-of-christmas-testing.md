Once upon a time there was a project lead working on a big project. As it got closer and closer to christmas projects were due and deployed to the magical kingdom of testing, the winds of change requests and testing blew strong.

On the eve of christmas as everyone sat around watching servers glowing, heating their hands on the charred sticks of ram and the still clicking hard drives. Unable to do anything but look on, the project lead hung his head wishing that Santa would bring him a full test suite tomorrow.

Merry Christmas and may all your tests pass.
