title: My first CBT session

---
Today I had my first CBT session. I’m hugely conflicted, I don’t know what I was expecting. My session was just a reiteration of the initial phone introduction. It seemed like a waste of time to me, I’m not discounting CBT at all.

I was given a pro-forma thought journal to fill out for the next sessions (earliest was 3 weeks!!!), I’d already seen this in the initial documentation that I’d been sent so I could have done this in preparation for this meeting rather than the next.

While we didn’t go into anything of substance in terms of CBT I did realise a few key things:

1. If this doesn’t work I’m going to have to work harder to sort things out for myself.
2. I really need to talk to someone professional about my feelings.
3. Psychotherapy is a damned hard job for someone, who do psychologists go to talk to?

Points 1 and 2 are huge steps in the right directions so who knows maybe it is working, subliminally… ** Buy me beer ** ** waves hand in the air mystically **
