This week I've found out I run a ridiculous amount of chat apps.

Here is a run down of what I have on my macbook:

* Hipchat - for work
* Skype - for dad and freelance work
* Airdroid - for my phone
* Pidgin/Adium - for hangouts, mostly to contact Hannah and Eli
* Slack - for NWDUG community
* Limechat - for #drupaluk and #phpnw
* Steam friends - not often used

All these apps fall into specific categories; work, social and play. It seems very excessive.
