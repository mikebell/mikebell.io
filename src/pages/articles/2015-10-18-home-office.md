Since moving to a new house I have an proper office for the first time so I'm determined to get it right.

I asked on twitter what remote workers would suggest, here are the results:

* Coffee shops as a nice change of scenery - [@jjmu15](https://twitter.com/jjmu15)
* A recurring theme is good headphones!
* A closed door to indicate "do no disturb" - [@blakehall](https://twitter.com/blakehall)
* Good music - [@jbloomfield](https://twitter.com/jbloomfield)
* Good coffee (duh!) - [@jbloomfield](https://twitter.com/jbloomfield)
* Comfortable chair - [@hussainweb](https://twitter.com/hussainweb)
* Good lighting - [@lewisnyman](https://twitter.com/lewisnyman) [@hussainweb](https://twitter.com/hussainweb)
* Good mic - [@longwave](https://twitter.com/longwave)

I have most of these already so it's just a case of getting it actually set up.

My keyboard is pretty loud so not sure how that's going to go down!
