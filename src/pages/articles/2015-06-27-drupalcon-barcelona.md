**This is an unpublished post that I've only just got round to posting.**

I'm writing this 3 days before everyone finds out that I'll be part of the Thursday keynote. Let me back track a bit.

19th July - Friday - I published a blog post with my candid take on the week. I went to bed then at 00:15 my phone dinged. Hannah was out so figured it was her getting in touch, I have pretty stringent rules on my phone so only the most important notifications ping me. I check my phone to see an email from Amanda Gosner, my session was accepted. I check the details WTF??? Why is my session only 25 minutes long, queue re-reading the email, Keynote? Wait backtrack a bit.

1. I've been accepted to DrupalCon Barcelona
2. I've been given part of a Keynote.

Sleep was not easy that night!

So, I'll be keynoting on the Thursday morning on Mental Health. Keeping this quiet has not been easy, I want to shout it from the roof tops, I want to make sure that as many people as possible come, Thursday morning keynote will be a tough time, a week of drinking and coding will mean that people are tired but seriously this stuff is important. I wouldn't be given then stage if it wasn't.

It's not really sunk in yet but there's a lot of things going through my head. I have a lot to live up to, not an easy challenge considering I live every day with Imposter Syndrome. It'll be a good experience either way.
