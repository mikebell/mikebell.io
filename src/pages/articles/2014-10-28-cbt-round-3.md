This was a very short session clocking in at 30 minutes over the phone.

I can see what we're trying to achieve through CBT but it just seems a bit pointless, I don't think we really covered much of importance. I much prefer in person sessions as I can't distract myself or become distracted by other things as easily.

I don't really have much to report on this session, in the next sessions we'll be covering breathing techniques to help bring my anxiety down and help control panic attacks more.

I'd be interested to see what other people's CBT session structure is like as like most people I'm going into this blindly.
