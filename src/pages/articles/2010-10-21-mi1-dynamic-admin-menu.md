title: MI1 Dynamic Admin Menu

---
<p>Record the most used admin menu items and create a menu containing those links. Possibly tie in with Root Candys drop down bar or custom menu support.</p><p>The idea behind these MI* (Module Idea)&nbsp;posts is for me to quickly post ideas that I have in the hope that I'll either write the module or someone else will have a go.</p>
