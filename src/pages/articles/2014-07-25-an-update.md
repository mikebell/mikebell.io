title: An Update

Hi everyone,

Firstly thank you so much for getting in touch, I'm overwhelmed by the response from people. I'm sorry to say I just can't reply to everyone it may seem odd but it's a lot of work I'm just not ready for.

I've been to the doctors and I'm getting help. I don't know how long it'll take to recover.

The Drupal and PHP community has been a great help in starting me off on the road to recovery. Thank you all so much for the support.

I've never been so scared in my entire life but finally there is light at the end of the tunnel.
