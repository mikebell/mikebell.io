I've not missed you not at all. I wish you weren't back but here we are my dear friend/enemy Propranolol.

The past few weeks have been really tough, break downs, anxiety attacks all fun stuff.

So there it is the beta blockers are back so I can retain some form of functionality I don't want this but it'll get me through the next few weeks when I can focus on rebuilding my mental health defenses.
