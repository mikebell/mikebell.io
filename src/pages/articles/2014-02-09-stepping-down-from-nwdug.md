As of the 6th February I’ve stepped down from NWDUG it’s something that I’ve been thinking about for a while now and I now have other things that need my focus. Phil Norton is a great person to work with and I hope that whoever steps up to help will have as much fun as I have over the past few years.

So whats next? Well I intend to ramp up my involvement with Code Club Manchester, it’s something that I believe in strongly and think I can make a great start with it. I’ll still be running Drupal Sprints Manchester (follow at http://twitter.com/drupalsprints) but the format will be different and new rules will be put into place.
