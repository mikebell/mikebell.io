title: Switching Off

---
It's that time of year again where I need a holiday and the opportunity to get away from everything.

 This week a colleague flippantly said that I'd be unable to switch off and required an internet connection. I was kind of offended by this as they assumed that they actually knew me.

To me holidays are sacred they're a time when you get to switch off and relax. Something that may seem quite alien to those in the business. I don't require an internet connection. In fact I look forward to not having one. Sure its handy but switching off is something I enjoy doing and feel necessary every now and then.
