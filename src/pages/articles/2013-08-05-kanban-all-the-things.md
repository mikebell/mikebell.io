I've started working on some really cool projects now that I have a bit of time spare. I have 4 that I'm running concurrently which is quite a lot considering at least 2 of them are quite big.

Knowing what you've achieved is an excellent way of keeping motivated and running that side by side with what's to be done gives you an overview of the entire project. To manage my projects I'm using Trello.com which has a really great interface and is dead easy to setup.

I'm fairly sure I'm using a bastardised version of Kanban but it's proving an effective management tool. Well worth a shot.
