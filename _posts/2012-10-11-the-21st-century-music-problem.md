title: The 21st Century Music Problem

I'm in an odd situation, my iPod 120gb has died and I have no mass storage media player.

I have a few alternatives but they aren't feasible with my 250gb+ music collection:

1. 250gb+ music player - these just don't exist, at least not in the same league as the iPod.
2. Streaming - not feasible, work connection is appalling and not fit for streaming and mobile bandwidth hasn't caught up with a 21st century media consumer.

So what should I do? (Hint: I'm not downsizing).
