It's that time again now that I'm well and truly full of drupalflu.

This years pickings were slim to none, not that there wasn't anything great out there but I just didn't have the time to go out and grab any. My time was spent attending sessions and talking to potential new clients on our booth (which was awesome!).

I did however grab a conference t-shirt which is great, as someone who collects a lot of cool and interesting shirts this one was pretty amazing, so congrats to the designers.

This years conference was great, so many good sessions to attend and as always it was great to meet up with other drupal people including lots from #drupal-uk. I'm so pleased I got to see Batman Live I thought it was a great show and even after my skeptisism it was worth it.

I came away with so many ideas that I can't wait to put into fluition. I particuarly like drush deploy, looking forward to seeing that get a stable release. I attended a great BoF on Kit/Build Kit/Features, something that I've been using for a while now.

Next years european DrupalCon is in Munich... Beer Beer and more Beer!
