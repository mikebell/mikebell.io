Last night my drush docset for Dash was accepted into the User Contributed section. This means you can now get the following drush commands offline through Dash:

* Drush Core
* Features
* Coder
* Search Api
* Module Builder
* Migrate
* Registry Rebuild

If you want to use this with Zeal then you can download the docset from here:
