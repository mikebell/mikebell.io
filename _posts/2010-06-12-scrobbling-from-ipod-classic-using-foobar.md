<p>I figured I'd write this as a reference for an IRC channel I op as quit a few people wonder how to Scrobble from an iPod Classic.  </p><p>You need a few things: </p><p>1. Foobar </p><p>2. foo_dop.dll - http://bit.ly/dBI3Cm </p><p>3. foo_audioscrobbler - http://bit.ly/cRBrGj </p><p>Place both dlls in your components folder and then restart foobar.</p><p>In File&gt;Preferences select Audioscrobbler and fill out your username and password, the click &quot;Import played tracks from portable devices&quot;. You should then be able to sync your iPod by going to File&gt;iPod and clicking synchronise. You don't have to fully synchronise it though check out View&gt;Console to see if there are any problems or how many tracks you've scrobbled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And that's it, enjoy!</p>
