Hello!

It's taken me a while to get round to writing something down, partly because I don't know what to write and partly becuase I wanted to switch CI tools since I removed Jenkins from my production environment.

This post is kind of a run down on 2018 and stuff I'll be doing this year. I'll split it into sections so it's easier to skip around if you don't want to read boring things.

## Bye Bye Drupal

I've finally made the switch out of Drupal into DevOps. The rate at which project requirements change and technology as well means that it's time to switch things up. I'm also bored with it, after 10 years of building sites I don't find using Drupal interesting anymore. Drupal always seems so slow to make changes and I'd rather do things that I really enjoy.

## Hello DevOps

It's fun, learning new tools and fitting things together like a massive jigsaw puzzle is great. I'm also really interesting in seeing tools mature and find their place in the DevOps ecosystem.
