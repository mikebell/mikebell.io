I'm proud to announce a new collaboration between the Drupal and WordPress communities in Manchester to provide a space to contribute back to each respective project. It's a great opportunity to get together and work on the projects that we love while being around like minded people.

The first sprint will be on the 19th July at TechHub in Manchester. You can sign up here - http://www.eventbrite.com/e/drupal-wordpress-sprints-manchester-tickets-12157905623 with lunch provided.

I'd like to thank Jenny Wong ([@miss_jwo](https://twitter.com/miss_jwo)) for helping to arrange this, I'm really looking forward to making this a long running collaboration between the two communities.
