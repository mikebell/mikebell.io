```alias d8build="composer create-project drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev --stability dev --no-interaction"```

It's too big for a tweet but it's certainly useful, saves me having to remember all the params. Stick that in your .bashrc or .zshrc and enjoy!

Run ```d8build sitename``` and watch it do it's stuff.
